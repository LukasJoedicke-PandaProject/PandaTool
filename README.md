# Panda - Tool

## What is panda?
Panda is an tool to better organize multiple accounts for the platform [Discord](https://discord.com/). 

It has an easy to use UI written in JavaFX.

It is using an self written API Wrapper to communicate with the Discord API.

The tool is not a freeware, so it is protected by the Panda - Launcher.

## Technology
A cool technology which is worth mentioning is [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).
I used OpenCV to train a neural network to solve some sort of image captchas, which happen to appear on some Servers.
